NOT YET FULLY IMPLEMENTED

ðŸ“š Learning and exploring Linux.

**NOTE**:

This was developed on macOS and for my own personal use.

## Overview

This repository is for me to explore Linux. That's a wide scope of technology! Because I develop on macOS, I need a test
bed for exploring Linux. I'll do this by exploring Linux in a Docker container by way of [remote development in VS Code
using a "Dev Container"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview).

I'll choose the [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) Linux distribution to experiment with for two reasons. First, it's a
common distribution to build containerized workloads like web servers on top of, and I've used it for many of my own
workloads. Secondly, Debian is in the middle of the spectrum between small distributions like [Arch](https://archlinux.org/)
and large distributions that can be used on the desktop like [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/). It seems like an effective
representative.

There are some miscellaneous things I'd like to learn about Linux (or even more broadly Unix-based systems and computing
tools) like SSH (again, not a Linux-specific thing), systemd, file permissions, Unix domain sockets, and more.


## Instructions

Follow these instructions to follow along with the learning journey presented by this codebase.

1. Start Docker
   * You should have Docker Desktop (or an alternative, like [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima)) installed and
     running.
1. Open this project in VS Code
1. Attach VS Code to the dev container
   * VS Code will prompt you with a notification to reopen the project in a dev container. Click the "Reopen in Container"
     button.
1. Show the Debian version
   * Issue the following command in the built-in VS Code terminal.
   * ```shell
     lsb_release -a
     ```
   * Altogether, it should look like this.
   * ```text
     vscode âžœ /workspaces/linux-playground $ lsb_release -a
     No LSB modules are available.
     Distributor ID: Debian
     Description:    Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)
     Release:        11
     Codename:       bullseye
     ```
   * Or, look at the version in the `/etc/debian_version` file. It should look like this.
   * ```text
     vscode âžœ /workspaces/linux-playground $ cat /etc/debian_version 
     11.6
     ```


## Wish List

General clean ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [ ] Start an SSH server. Connect to it from another container. Connect to it from my Mac host.
  * Maybe use password-based authentication? Public/private key would be better.
* [ ] Install a package, or series of packages using the package manager (what is it apt-get? I always get them
  confused)
